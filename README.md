# JavascriptGrapher

Proposal:
The idea is to grab data with some sort of front end, process it using Javascript, and interpret it into a linear regression, which is then displayed to a user.


React UI?
Use Node.js to talk to Python processing?


To run in Node (not yet finalized):
---
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
---
 Go to localhost:5000
