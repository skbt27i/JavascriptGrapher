# JavascriptGrapher

Proposal:
The idea is to grab data with some sort of front end, process it using Javascript, and interpret it into a linear regression, which is then displayed to a user.


React UI?
Use Node.js to talk to Python processing?

 To run (eventually):


```
npm start
```


 Go to localhost:3000
