# JavascriptGrapher

Proposal:
The idea is to grab data with some sort of front end, process it using Javascript, and interpret it into a linear regression, which is then displayed to a user.

Project Status:
- Frontend now working, no linear regression line however
- Need to send data to backend, process it, and return a linreg equation/correlation for frontend

To run working frontend (scatter plotter)...
```
Cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Go to localhost:3000
```


 To run everything (eventually):
 Go to the backend, then... 
```
npm install
npm run-script
Go to localhost:3000
```
