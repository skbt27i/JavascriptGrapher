# JavascriptGrapher


This app grabs data points with a React frontend, processes it, and interprets it with a Node Express backend. A linear regression and its corresponding equation are displayed to the user.

Project Status:
- Frontend and backend now working, rough display of LinReg equation/trendline/coeff of determination
- Need to properly format LinReg equation and r^2, add axis labels
